Along with Corinne Drewery, he is part of the duo that makes up Swing Out Sister.Born in Manchester, England, Connell played in the Manchester post-punk band The Immediates, before joining new wave funk pioneers, A Certain Ratio. He was also a member of the Manchester based jazz/pop band Kalima who were signed to Factory Records, whilst he was also a member of A Certain Ratio. A few years later he teamed up with former Magazine drummer Martin Jackson and Greg Wilson (DJ), and they released an inventive electronic album called UK Electro in 1984.Swing Out Sister began in earnest in 1985, when Connell and Jackson teamed up with Corinne Drewery. Since the band's establishment, he has been the main composer and arranger for Swing Out Sister's music, including the UK and US top ten hit, \"Breakout\".Apart from his work with Swing Out Sister, Connell has produced and arranged music for other artists, and recently he wrote the musical score for a short film called The Knickerman, directed by Sonja Phillips. He also contributed to Quando Quango's album, Pigs & Battleships.Most recently, Connell and Drewery have been promoting their latest album, Beautiful Mess."

He also contributed to versions of the songs \"Push It Along\", \"Youthful Expression\", and \"Can I Kick It?\". He also appeared in five of the 13 music videos the group filmed. \r\rHe left the group in 1991 to attend culinary school. He continues to produce songs with former bandmates Phife Dawg and DJ Rasta Root.\r\rHe appeared only on one album, People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm. He had actual vocals recorded for the Tribe's second album, The Low End Theory, but when he left the group they were removed. He was mentioned in a skit on Midnight Marauders—the members of the group are listed followed by the phrase \"A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y\", with the final letter referring to the fact that White was only an occasional member. He was also mentioned on Phife's solo album Ventilation: Da LP.\r\rAs a part of the Native Tongues collaboration, White appeared on \"Pease Porridge\" by De La Soul, on their 1991 album De La Soul Is Dead, which features several other Native Tongues rappers as well.\rIn 2006 White joined A Tribe Called Quest on stage during their performance at the Bumbershoot festival. He is also the manager of Washington D.C.-based rapper Head-Roc.\r\rHe was honored along with the rest of A Tribe Called Quest in VH1's fourth annual Hip Hop Honors ceremony.\r",

                "abstract": "Ali Shaheed Muhammad was born and raised in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. At an early age Ali became fascinated with music. His earliest memory of this fascination was toting around a yellow Mickey Mouse transistor radio he received as a gift. \"I brought that with me everywhere; I was comforted by the sounds that came from that little box,\" he says. Other memories lead to house parties his mother would throw where his Uncle Mike would deejay. It was at one of these parties that the then eight-year-old Ali took control of the mixer and turntables and began his life long musical journey. Ali went from local neighborhood deejay to a world-renowned producer and musician, forming not one but two popular bands.\r\rThe first group, A Tribe Called Quest, was where \"Mr. Muhammad\" partnered up with band mates Q-Tip and Phife. The hip-hop trio recorded five albums. The three stand incontestable as hip-hop classics. Their innovation changed the sound of hip-hop and R & B with jazzy, melodic beats. Tribe exited the world via the same stage as The Beatles and The Police, but their influence still lives with artists like D’Angelo, Common, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, The Roots and Musiq.\r\rAfter Tribe, Ali co-founded a new super trio named Lucy Pearl. Here with band members Dawn Robinson and Raphael Saadiq, he was able to explore more of his music abilities. Lucy Pearl fused funk, rock, R & B and hip-hop bringing a new energy and sound which remains to be duplicated.\r\rAli is also a 4-time Grammy nominee -- twice with A Tribe Called Quest, once for works with D’Angelo and once for Lucy Pearl. With plenty of production credits, no Grammy wins and two defunct groups, what is left for the DJ with plenty more music in his soul?\r",
